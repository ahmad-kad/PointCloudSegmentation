Your current README.md file is quite comprehensive, but here are some suggestions to make it even better:

1. **Add a Table of Contents**: This helps users quickly navigate to different sections.
2. **Expand the Project Description**: Provide more details about what the project does, its goals, and its applications.
3. **Add Examples**: Include example commands and outputs to illustrate how to use the project.
4. **Improved Formatting**: Use badges for things like build status, license, and version.
5. **Contributing Guidelines**: Add a section detailing how others can contribute to the project.

Here is an improved version of your README.md:

## Project Description
Point2Net is designed to perform instance-level segmentation on 3D point cloud data. It leverages advanced deep learning techniques to accurately segment and classify points in a 3D space, making it suitable for applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and 3D modeling.

## Features
- Instance segmentation for 3D point clouds
- End-to-end training pipeline
- Supports [ScanNet](http://www.scan-net.org/) dataset
- Experiment tracking with [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.com/)

## Requirements
- CUDA-capable GPU (8GB+ VRAM)
- Python 3.8+
- CUDA 11.0+
- Ubuntu 20.04+

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmad-kad/PointCloudSegmentation.git
   cd PointCloudSegmentation
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
```bash
# Data Preparation
python preprocess_data.py --config configs/preprocessing.yaml --raw-dir /path/to/scannet

# Training
python train.py --config configs/training_config.yaml --data-dir data/processed

# Inference
python inference.py --checkpoint model.pth --input scene.ply
```

### Dataset
We use the [ScanNet](http://www.scan-net.org/) dataset for training and evaluation:
```bibtex
@inproceedings{dai2017scannet,
    title     = {ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D Reconstructions of Indoor Scenes},
    author    = {Dai, Angela and Chang, Angel X. and Savva, Manolis and 
                 Halber, Maciej and Funkhouser, Thomas and Nie{\ss}ner, Matthias},
    booktitle = {Proc. Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), IEEE},
    year      = {2017}
}
```

### Tools
Experiment tracking and visualization powered by [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.com/):
```bibtex
@misc{wandb,
    title  = {Experiment Tracking with Weights and Biases},
    year   = {2020},
    note   = {Software available from wandb.com},
    url    = {https://www.wandb.com/},
    author = {Biewald, Lukas}
}
```

### Key Research
Built upon the [PointNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593) architecture:
```bibtex

    title   = {PointNet: Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification 
               and Segmentation},
    author  = {Qi, Charles R and Su, Hao and Mo, Kaichun and Guibas, Leonidas J},
    journal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:1612.00593},
